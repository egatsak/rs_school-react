# Week 2

## React. Forms

### How-to

- `git clone #repository-url#`
- `cd rs_school-react`
- `git checkout react_api`
- `npm i`
- rename `.env.example` to `.env`

### How-to pt.2

- `npm run dev` starts in dev mode
- `npm run build` creates a production build
- `npm run test` runs unit & react components tests
- `npm run lint` runs linter
- `npm run test:cov` runs tests and shows the coverage
- `npm run lint:typecheck` checks if there are TS errors

If cards on the main page don't load, you might need to register at `https://the-one-api.dev/`, get the API key and change it in `.env` file and in `vite.config.ts`.

Please don't hesitate to text me if there are any questions!
